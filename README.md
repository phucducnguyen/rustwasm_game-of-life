## Rules
  Every cell interacts with its eight neighbours, which are the cells that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent. At each step in time, the following transitions occur:

    *Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by underpopulation.

    *Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.

    *Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.

    *Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
